# nocked on the door. A man answered.
#     "Hi, I'm looking for Shiva Jay", you said, "Does he live here?"
#     "Oh, I'm Shiva Jay! Nice to meet ya! What's your name?", he replied.
#     "Uh, Tony. As in, Tony Yin."
#     "Ah. So, what takes you here?"
#     "I'm just searching for something. It's uh, well, I don't know what it's 
# called, but I know what it looks like."

passages. Anyways, sorry for the interruption.

# So, you walked into Shiva Jay's house and you accepted his tea. It tasted be-
# tter than you originally thought. However, after drinking the tea, your stom-
# ach starts to ache, and within seconds you pass out. It appears that the tea 
# was poisoned

# Anyways, you died from poison within Shiva Jay's tea. Better luck next time.
